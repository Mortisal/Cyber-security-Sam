         <p class="dark"> How companies use cyber security to protect themselves </p>
         <p> Companies are the ones that have the most cause to protect their data as they have a significant amount of it and almost all of it is very important data, marketing data, profits as well as employee information, this means that most companies have a vested interest in protecting their assets. Typically they ill hire a cyber-security expert in order to keep their secrets safe as well as people to try and find holes in their security, to constantly test it for holes and exploits that a rival company or an opportunistic hacker could use to breach the companies fire wall. This all in an effort to try and keep their company as secure as possible, however this is expenisve and some comapnies tend to spend as little as possible on, espeacally those ran by those who are older, this leads to their security being comprimaised and more often than not their data being stolen. </p>
         <p class="dark">The dangers of a lack of cyber security</p>
         <p>
         There are many dangers that revolve around having very little to no Cyber Security, this can be something simple like some being able to go into the server and perhaps making it run a little slower than it usually would, however there are also much larger issues that can arise from it such as having cutomer data stolen from the company or yourself if not kept under a tight enough lock. There are several steps that can be taken in order to prevent this, for example being carful where you place these files as they may be easier to access in certain places than in others. Make sure your passwords are something that isn't going to be guess very easily or brute forced.
