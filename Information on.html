          <p class="dark"> What is cyber security?</p>
          <p> Cyber security is according to the website IT governance <em><strong>"Cyber security comprises technologies, processes and controls that are designed to protect systems, networks and data from cyber attacks. Effective cyber security reduces the risk of cyber attacks, and protects organisations and individuals from the unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks and technologies." </strong></em>We feel this is a rather comprehensive definition on what cyber security is.</p>
         <p class="dark">What improvements have been made in recent years? </p>
         <p> There have been many different improvements in cyber security in recent years as it becomes increasingly more important to our daily lives, for example there are pieces of software called VPN's or virtual private networks which allow the user to make it seem like they are somewhere else if some should try and trace their IP address. These improvements are mostly due to the need have them as those who want to commit cybercrime have gotten much better at getting through various different softwareâ€™s designed to keep thing out of our personal data. </p>
         <p> Obviously these improvements haven't stopped cyber-attacks as there are people who want to use your data for malicious purposes, however the threat isn't always a hacker or genius computer prodigy, sometimes we compromise our own cyber security as social media sites, such as Facebook hold a lot more data than what is available to the common user and typically they retain the most of this data.</p>
